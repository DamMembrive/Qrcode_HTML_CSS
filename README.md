- Solution URL: [Add solution URL here](https://your-solution-url.com)

## My process

- Started with page background, then followed doing the main bigger components like the white square, QR Code Image, and then the text. At the end, worked on doing the responsive design. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

I could practice my skills with HTML and CSS. So far it was very good because I could learn more about the tags and also Visual Code, because before I was using Sublime. 

// Shortcuts
    CMND OPTION J for DevTools

// tag @media only screen and (max-device_width:480px)
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">    
    border-radius 
// Google Fonts


### Continued development

For the future I want to improve and get to know how to solve more challenges using HTML and CSS. In my midn i feel that I know in theory but still I have a lack during practices. 
I need to focus more on position and responsible design.
